# Mentor Mash

## The Problem
Women face several challenges as entrepreneurs and small business owners, including finding access to mentors or people who are willing to help them with their goals. These barriers often prevent women from breaking into their desired industry.

## The Solution
Our app helps foster a community of like-minded mentors for women entrepreneurs and business owners by pairing mentees in search of a valuable mentor with a mentor who is already in the industry and will help mentees put their foot in the door.
